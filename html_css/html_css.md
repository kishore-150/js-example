2). Explain different ways to apply CSS ?
   
    CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
      a) Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
      b) Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
      c) External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.

3). Explain about CSS box-diagram ?
 
    a) Border:  It is a region between the padding-box and the margin.Its proportions are determined
       by the width and the height of the boundary.
    b) Margin:  It is a region between the boundary and the edge of the border.The proportion of the 
       margin region is equal to the margin-box width and height. It is better to separate the product from its neighbor nodes.
    c) Padding: It is the space around the subject-area  and inside the border-box.The height and
       width of the padding box defines its proportions.
    d) Content: Material such as text, photographs, or other digital media is included in this area.
       It is constrained by the information edge, and its proportions are dictated by the width and height of the content enclosure.

         2).Combinator selectors. (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
         3).Pseudo-class selectors. (select elements based on a certain state)
         4).Pseudo-elements selectors. (select and style a part of an element)
         5).Attribute selectors. (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
